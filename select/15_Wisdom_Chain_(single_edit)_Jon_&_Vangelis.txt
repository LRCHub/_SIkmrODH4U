Did we know the severace thruout reality
We see how wonderful releasing it is.
Do we cross the Great Divide that spellbinds us
To one degree, this further dimension it is.
Locked in our memory.
Locked in the wisdom chain.
Locked in our memories.
Locked in the wisdom chain.
Do we chase within without, this glowing world,
Come on come out, this future tradition it is.
Can we learn to memorize this mesmerizing music,
Planetary transition it is.
Locked in our memory (locked in our memory)
Locked in this wisdom chain (locked in the wisdom chain)
Locked in our memories (locked in our memories)
Locked in the world of the first
The first time... the first time... the first time
Heaven, heaven, heaven (heaven, heaven)
Watching milli-magnified this fast approaching change of pace
We enter in this human, Love! Love!
Learning quickly enterprising rhythms of the wisdom chain
For really all purpose, Love! Love!
Watching us watching (bringing the wisdom chain)
Watching us watching (watching us, watching us, watching us)
Bringing the wisdom chain
Watching us watching (watching us, watching us, watching us)
Success!
