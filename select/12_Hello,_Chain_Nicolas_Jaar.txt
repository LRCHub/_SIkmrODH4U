Hello chain Think I'll drop my anchor in that harbor over there
Lovely ladies, smell 'em through the smoke Seven days at sea
Can make you hungry for a poke Even stokers need a little stoke!
Lovely ladies,
Waiting for a bite Waiting for the customers who only come at night
Lovely ladies, waiting for the call

Standing up or lying down or any way at all Bargain prices up against
The wall What pretty hair,
What pretty locks you got there What luck you got,
It's worth a centime my dear I'll take the lot Don't touch me!
Leave me alone

Let's make a price,
I'll give you all of ten francs Just think of
That It pays a debt Just think of that What can I do?
It pays a debt Ten francs may save my poor Cosette Give me the dirt,
Who's that bit over there A bit of skirt,
She's the one sold her hair She's got a kid,
Sends her all that she can I might have known,
There is always some man Lovely lady,
Come along and join us Lovely lady Come on dearie,
Why all the fuss You're no grander than the rest of us Life has
Dropped you at the bottom of the heap Join your sisters— —Make money
In your sleep That's right, dearie, let him have the lot That's right,
Dearie, show him what you've got Come on, Captain,
You can wear your shoes Don't it make a
Change to have a girl who can't refuse?
Easy money, lying on a bed Just as well they never see the hate
That's in your head Don't they know
They're making love to one already dead?
